// WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?!!
// A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

// Why do I need to know this?
// Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!
// It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

// How do you improve at this stuff?
// 1. Devise a plan for solving problems
// 2. Master common problem solving patterns

// Problem Solving
// 1. Understand the Problem
// 2. Explore concrete examples
// 3. Break it down
// 4. Solve/Simplify
//  - If you can't, then solve a simpler problem
// 5. Look back and refactor

// UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM ---
// Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

// EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES ---
// Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
// Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.
// Start with simple examples
// Progress to more complex examples
// Explore examples with empty inputs
// Explore examples with invalid inputs

// BREAK IT DOWN ---
// Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

// SOLVE / SIMPLIFY ---
// Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
// Temporarily ignore that difficulty
// Write a simplified solution
// Then incorporate that difficulty back in

// LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR --
// Can you check the result?
// Can you derive the result differently?
// Can you understand it at a glance?
// Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
// Can you improve the performance of your solutions?
// Can you think of other ways to refactor?
// How have other people solved this problem?
